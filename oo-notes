Verify connection by doing "get user"
    - store user.id, user.full-name, user.default-org-id, user.derfault-project-id
    - don't store these details - you get them as a product of connection verification anyway
    - Connection object has
        + user-id
        + user-full-name
        + default-org-id
        + default-org-name
        + default-project-id (maybe empty)
        + current-project-id 
        + current-device-id 

The default organization comes with /user.  If don't have a default project,
then we can get /projects using the org-id

Rules for translation of packet API documentation to method calls on object
    - Where there is one component for the endpoint
        => Call on the connection object directly

        Packet API:  GET /user
        Cannonical: $con.GET-user
        Alternate:  $con.get-user
        Packet API: 
        Cannonical: 
        Alternate: 

    - Where there is two components for the endpoint and the second
      component is a field/ID;
        => Use the ID as a positional parameter
        => If the first component is a plural, replace it with the singular
           as the need for an ID means we're working with one item.
        => The friendlier alternate adds '-details' to 'get'

        Packet API: GET /devices/{id}    - retrieve a device's details
        Cannonical: $con.device(id).GET
        Alternate:  $con.device(id).get-details

        Packet API: PUT /devices/{id}   - update a device
        Cannonical: $con.device(id).PUT
        Alternate:  $con.device(id).update

    - Where there are three components for the endpoint and the second
      component is a field/ID;
        => Use the first component as the method call on the connection object
        => Use the ID as a positional parameter to that method call
        => If the first component is a plural, replace it with the singular
           as the need for an ID means we're working with one item.

        Packet API: GET /projects/{id}/devices    - retrieve all devices of a project
        Cannonical: $con.project(id).GET-devices
        Alternate:  $con.project(id).get-devices

        Packet API: POST /projects/{id}/devices   - create a device
        Cannonical: $con.project(id).POST-devices
        Alternate:  $con.project(id).create-device
